# How to use
There will be two exe files in the archive: ConfigEditor.exe and SBGR.exe
ConfigEditor.exe - this is the configuration file for the program.
1. AppID field - enter in this field the AppID of the game for boost game hours in steam
2. Minimize to Tray - is a function that hides the program in the tray (I did this so that it wouldn't interfere).
3. Autorun - is a function that launches the program when the system starts up
4. Check for Updates - check for program updates

Now let's move on to SBGR.exe
